# noinstagram

I got rid of my IG account some time ago, but I'd still like to see [photos from my wife](https://instagram.com/juiskie/) and [our dog](https://instagram.com/scooterpablovance/). I was just visiting the IG website for each public user I wanted to view, but that was way too much work. So I [built this](https://datvance.github.io/noinstagram/) one Sunday.

## Want your own noinstagram page?

- fork this repo
- set up [github pages](https://pages.github.com) for the forked repo and point it at /docs
- edit accounts.json with your preferred IG accounts and/or hashtags
- sign up for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) (it's free), add a Github Access Token, and start building

You can also build using the noish.sh script. Just edit that script and set your GitHub username, and set
an environment variable with your GitHub access token.  

### also...

- thanks to [instagram-php-scraper](https://github.com/postaddictme/instagram-php-scraper) for the hard work
- style and features are pretty basic, but hey, pull requests welcome
- there are some variables in build.php you might want to change
- Recently CircleCI shut down my builds for some reason, so YMMV
